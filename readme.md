Welcome to Sudoku solver developed by Aryan. All you need to do to run this project is run the index.html on a HTTP server host. There is no other requirement as its frontend is integrated with backend with JS. When you go to the index endpoint, a 9x9 grid would appear and you can input a valid unsolved sudoku and then hit the solve button and you would get the fully solved sudoku output in the grid itself.

Please ensure that the system has JS installed.
There is a very simple way to run this project , which is first to install a static http-server from the following link
https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server

Then, simply executing the http-server command in the directory where index.html is present will start the server on port 8080.
