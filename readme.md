Welcome to Sudoku solver developed by Aryan. All you need to do to run this project is run the index.html on a HTTP server host. There is no other requirement as its frontend is integrated with backend with JS. When you go to the index endpoint, a 9x9 grid would appear and you can input a valid unsolved sudoku and then hit the solve button and you would get the fully solved sudoku output in the grid itself.
